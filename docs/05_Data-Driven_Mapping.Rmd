# Lesson 5. Data-driven Mapping

*Data-driven mapping* refers to the process of using data values to determine the symbology of mapped features. Color, shape, and size are the three most common graphic elements used to symbolize data-driven maps. Data-driven maps are often referred to as thematic maps.

### Types of Thematic Maps

There are two primary types of thematic maps:

- `Choropleth maps`: set the color of areas (polygons) by data value

- `Point symbol maps`: set the color or size of points by data value

We review both of these types of maps in more detail in this lesson. First, let's take a quick look at choropleth maps. 

```{r, message=F}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(here)
```

# 5.1 Choropleth Maps

Choropleth maps are the most common type of thematic map.

Let's use an `sf` data.frame of counties data to make a choropleth map.

First, read in the counties data with the `st_read` function.

```{r}
counties <- st_read(here("notebook_data",
                         "california_counties",
                         "CaliforniaCounties.shp"))
```
Then, make a map of our counties.

```{r}
plot(counties$geometry)
```


Now, take a look at the spatial dataframe.

```{r}
head(counties)
```

In particular, we are interested in the columns with numeric values as these are the ones typically used to make data maps.


To get started, let's create a choropleth map by setting the color of each county based on the value in the population per square mile column (`POP12_SQMI`).

Recall that `sf`'s plot method does this by default! So, here's the quickest way to make a choropleth:

```{r}
plot(counties['POP12_SQMI'])
```

By default, `sf::plot` linearly scales the colors to the data values. This is called a `proportional color map`.

- A `proportional color map` will have a legend with a continuous color ramp rather than discrete data ranges.

- A key benefit of a `proportional color map` is that it depicts the full range of data values without imposing any groupings.

### Choropleth mapping with `tmap`

We can also use `tmap` to create thematic maps. This package gives us greater control over the visualization details.

In `tmap`, instead of setting the `col` argument to the same static value (e.g. 'red', '#ef03a5') for all features, we can set it to the name of the column by which we want our polygons colored (e.g. 'POP12_SQMI').

```{r}
# Set the mapping mode to a static plot (not interactive)
tmap_mode('plot')  

# Map the county polygons colored by the values in the POP12_SQMI column
tm_shape(counties) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'POP12_SQMI',
              title = "Population Density per mi^2")
```

By default, `tmap` uses a yellow-orange-brown (YlOrBr) `sequential color palette` for thematic maps and bins those colors into 3 to 7 classes of approximately equal intervals with rounded values for class breaks.

Of course, we can also use tmap's interactive mapping mode. Do you recall the syntax for:

- setting the tmap mode to static vs interactive mapping? 

- or toggling between these two modes?

Let's make an interactive map, making our layer partially transparent, i.e. `alpha = 0.4`, so that we can see the basemap through our polygons.

- This transparency may be more or less noticeable depending on the selected basemap!

````{r}
tmap_mode('view')

tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)  # force tmap to display invalid polygons

tm_shape(counties) +
  tm_polygons(col='POP12_SQMI', alpha=0.5,
              title = "Population Density per mi^2")
```

That's really the heart of of creating a choropleth map with `tmap`. To set the color of the features based on the values in a column, set the `col` argument to the column name in the `sf` data.frame (cast as a string!).

### Practice

Redo the map above, but mapping population (`POP2012`) NOT population density.

```{r}
# Map of County Population

```

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Question**

What map better conveys county population - `POP12_SQMI` or `POP2012`?

## The Challenge of Thematic Maps

The goal of a thematic map is to use color to visualize the spatial distribution of a variable.

Another goal is to use color to effectively and quickly convey information. For example, 

- maps use brighter or richer colors to signify higher values,

- and leverage cognitive associations such as mapping water with the color blue.

There are two major challenges when creating thematic maps:

1. Our eyes are drawn to the color of larger areas or linear features, even if the values of smaller features are more significant.

2. The range of data values is rarely evenly distributed across all observations and thus the colors can be misleading.

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Questions** 

- Do you see this either of these problems in our population-density map?

  - Take a look at the histogram below as you consider the above question.

```{r}
hist(counties$POP12_SQMI,
     breaks = 40, 
     main = 'Population Density per mi^2')
```

There are three main techniques for dealing with these mapping challenges:

1. Color palettes

1. Data transformations

1. Classification schemes


## 5.2 Color Palettes

There are three main types of color palettes (or color maps), each of which has a different purpose:

- **diverging** - a "diverging" set of colors are used so emphasize mid-range values as well as extremes.

- **sequential** - usually with a single or multi color hue to emphasize differences in order and magnitude, where darker colors typically mean higher values

- **qualitative** - a contrasting set of colors to identify distinct categories and avoid implying quantitative significance.

<img src="http://www.gnuplotting.org/figs/colorbrewer.png"></img>

> **Tip**: Sites like [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=Blues&n=3) let's you play around with different types of color maps.

To see the names of all color palettes avaialble to `tmap`, try the following command. You may need to enlarge the output image.

```{r}
RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all()
```

As a best practice, a `qualitative` color palette should not be used with `quantitative` data and vice versa. For example, consider this map that EDM.com published of top dance tracks by state.

<img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2AnLp-hwFUEjkW9TxSt_U1-rv8k=/0x0:1198x777/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:1198x777):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3420378/pandora.0.jpg" width="600px"></img>

## 5.3  Transforming Count Data

For a number of reasons, data are often distributed in aggregated form. For example, the Census Bureau collects data from individual people, households and businesses and distributes it aggregated to states, counties, and census tracts, etc.

When the aggregated data are counts, like total population, they can be transformed to densities, proportions and ratios. These normalized variables are more comparable across regions that differ greatly in size.

Let's consider this in terms of our  data.

- **Counts**
    - data counts, aggregated by feature
        - *e.g. population within a county*

- **Densities**
    - counts aggregated by feature and normalized by feature area
        - *e.g. population per square mile within a county*

- **Proportions / Percentages**
    - value in a specific category divided by total value across in all categories
        - *e.g. proportion of the county population that is white compared to the total county population*

- **Rates / Ratios**
    - value in one category divided by value in another category
        - *e.g. homeowner-to-renter ratio would be calculated as the number of homeowners (c_owners/ c_renters)*

The basic cartographic rule is that when mapping areas that differ in size you never map counts since those differences in size make the comparison less invalid.

# 5.4 Classification schemes

Another way to make more meaningful maps is to improve the way in which data values are mapped to colors.

The common alternative to a proportional color map is to use a **classification scheme** to create a **graduated color map**. This is the standard way to create a **choropleth map**.

A **classification scheme** is a method for binning continuous data values into 4-7 classes (the default is 5) and map those classes to a color palette. 

### The commonly used classifications schemes:

- **Equal intervals** or **Pretty**
    - equal-size data ranges (e.g., values within 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, etc.)
    - <u>pros</u>:
        - best for data spread across entire range of values
        - easily understood by map readers
    - <u>cons</u>:
        - but avoid if you have highly skewed data or a few big outliers
 
- **Quantiles**
    - equal number of observations in each bin
    - <u>pros</u>:
        - looks nice, becuase it best spreads colors across full set of data values
        - thus, it's often the default scheme for mapping software
    - <u>cons</u>:
        - bin ranges based on the number of observations, not on the data values
        - thus, different classes can have very similar or very different values.

- **Natural breaks**
    - minimize within-class variance and maximize between-class differences
    - e.g. 'fisher-jenks',
    - <u>pros</u>:
        - great for exploratory data analysis, because it can identify natural groupings
    - <u>cons</u>:
        - class breaks are best fit to one dataset, so the same bins can't always be used for multiple years
 
- **Head/Tails**
  - a new relatively new scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution
  
- **Manual** 
    - classifications are user-defined
    - <u>pros</u>: 
        - especially useful if you want to slightly change the breaks produced by another scheme
        - can be used as a fixed set of breaks to compare data over time
    - <u>cons</u>:
        - more work involved

### Classification schemes and `tmap`

Classification schemes can be implemented using the `tmap` geometry functions (`tm_polygons`, `tm_dots`, etc.) by setting a value for the **style** argument.

Here are some of the `tmap` keyword names for `classification styles` that we can use (from the docs: `?tm_polygons`):

-  `equal`, `quantile`,`fisher`, `jenks`, `headtails`, `fixed`, `kmeans`, `pretty`.

For more information about these classification schemes see `?classIntervals` or sources such as [this page](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html) in the Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow ebook.

--------------------------

#### Classification schemes in action

Let's redo the last map using the `quantile` classification scheme.

- What is different about the code? About the output map?

```{r}
tmap_mode('plot')
# Plot population density - mile^2
tm_shape(counties) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'POP12_SQMI',
              style = "quantile",
              alpha = 0.5,
              title = "Population Density per mi^2")
```

### Practice

Redo the previous map with these classification schemes: `headtails`, `equal`, `jenks`

- Which one do you like best?


### User Defined Classification Schemes

You may get pretty close to your final map without being completely satisfied. In this case you can manually define a classification scheme.

Let's customize our map with a `user-defined` classification scheme where we manually set the breaks for the bins using the `classification_kwds` argument.

```{r}
tm_shape(counties) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'POP12_SQMI',
              palette = "YlGn", 
              style = 'fixed',
              breaks = c(0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, max(counties$POP12_SQMI)),
              title = "Population Density per Square Mile")
```

Since we are customizing our plot, we can also edit our legend to specify the text, so that it's easier to read.

- We'll use `tm_add_legend` to build our own customized legend.

```{r}
tm_shape(counties) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'POP12_SQMI',
              palette = "YlGn", 
              style='fixed',
              breaks = c(0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, max(counties$POP12_SQMI)),
              legend.show = F) +
tm_add_legend('fill', col = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(6, "YlGn"),
              border.col = "black",
              title = "Population Density per Sq Mile",
              labels = c('<50','50 to 100','100 to 200','200 to 300','300 to 400','>400'))
```


#### Let's plot a ratio

If we look at the columns in our dataset, we see we have a number of variables
from which we can calculate proportions, rates, and the like.

Let's try that out:

```{r}
head(counties)
```

Let's calculate the percent of the population that is hispanic and save it to a new column. Then, we can use that to create a choropleth map.

```{r}
# calculate percent hispanic as a new column
counties$pct_hispanic = counties$HISPANIC/counties$POP2012 * 100

# Plot percent hispanic as choropleth
tm_shape(counties) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'pct_hispanic',
              palette = 'Blues', 
              style = 'fixed',
              breaks = c(0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100),
              border.col = "darkgrey",
              lwd = 1.5,
              legend.show = F) + 
tm_add_legend('fill', col = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, "Blues"),
              border.col = "darkgrey",
              title = "Percent Hispanic Population",
              labels = c('<20%',
                         '20% - 40%',
                         '40% - 60%',
                         '60% - 80%',
                         '80% - 100%'))
```

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Question**

1. What new options and operations have we added to our code?

1. How many values do we specify in the `breaks` vector, and how many bins are in the map legend? Why?


## 5.5 Point Maps

Choropleth maps are great, but point maps enable us to visualize our spatial data in another way. 

If you know both mapping methods you can expand how much information you can show in one map. 

For example, point maps are a great way to map `counts` because the varying sizes of areas are deemphasized.

The `tm_dot` element makes it easy to create point maps dynamically from polygon data! 

```{r}
# County population counts as a point map!
tmap_mode('plot')

# Add the county polygon borders as a basemap
tm_shape(counties) + 
  tm_borders(col = "grey") +
  
# Then map the county centroids as points colored by population counts
  tm_shape(counties) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'POP2012',
              palette = 'YlOrRd', 
              style = 'jenks',
              border.col = "black",  # dot borders only visible in interactive mode!
              border.lwd = 1,
              border.alpha = 1,
              size = .5,
              legend.show = T) 
```

This is another useful type of data transformation for making effective maps.

### More Point Data Maps

Let's read in some data that is more typically encoded with point geometry - Alameda County schools.

```{r}
schools_df <- read.csv(here("notebook_data",
                            "alco_schools.csv"))

head(schools_df)
```

We got it from a plain CSV file, let's promote it to an `sf` data.frame.

```{r}
schools_sf <- st_as_sf(schools_df, 
                       coords = c('X','Y'),
                       crs = 4326)
```

Then we can map it.

```{r}
plot(schools_sf)
```

What is useful about the above display of the maps for each column in the dataframe is that at a glance you can see the type of data variable and get a sense of the range of values.

The default `sf::plot` point map for a numeric data column is a **proportional color map** that linearly scales the `color` of the point symbol by the data values.

```{r}
# Point map of API - Academic Performance Index
plot(schools_sf['API'])
```

### Point maps with `tmap`

Let's try creating the same map with tmap.

```{r}
tmap_mode('plot')
tm_shape(schools_sf) + 
  tm_dots(col = "API")
```

The basic `tmap` graduated color map needs some customization to shine, especially in plot mode!

By default, `tmap` uses a yellow-orange-brown (YlOrBr) `sequential color palette` and the `pretty` classification scheme for point thematic maps. These are the same defaults that are used for `tmap` choropleth maps. But point maps that symbolize data values by color are called **Graduated Color Maps**. In spite of the different map names, the color and classification scheme options are almost identical in `tmap`!  However, some options will be different - for example, a `size` parameter makes sense for a point radius but not a polygon!

> See `?tm_dot` for more information about the options for customizing point maps! For example...

```{r}
# API Graduated Color Map
tm_shape(schools_sf) +
  tm_dots(col = 'API', 
          size = 0.15,
          palette = 'Reds', 
          style = 'fixed',
          breaks = c(0, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000),
          border.col = 'grey',
          legend.show = F) + 
  tm_add_legend('fill', 
                title = 'Alameda County, school API scores',
                labels = c('<200', 
                           '[200,400)', 
                           '[400,600)', 
                           '[600,800)', 
                           '>800'),
                col = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(5, "Reds")) +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c('right', 'top'))
```

### Proportional Symbol Maps

Another important type of point map is the **proportional symbol map**. These are like proportial color maps but instead of associating symbol color with data values they associate symbol size. You can make these in `tmap` with the **tm_bubbles** function.

The schools data does not contain any good variables for proportional symbol mapping so we will read in a supplemental file of National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) data and join it to the school points.

```{r}
df = read.csv(here("notebook_data",
                   "other",
                   "PolicyMap_NCES_Data_20210429.csv"))

# head(df,2)

df2 = df[c('School.Name',
           'Student.Teacher.Ratio',
           'Free.and.Reduced.price.Lunch.Eligible.Students')]

colnames(df2) <- c('Site',
                   'STRatio',
                   'RLunch')

# head(df2,2)

schools_sf2 <- merge(schools_sf, df2, by = "Site")

# head(schools_sf2,2)
```

```{r}
tmap_mode('plot')

tm_shape(schools_sf2) + 
  tm_bubbles(size = "RLunch", 
             col = "pink", 
             border.col = 'black', 
             title.size = "Students Eligible for Free/Reduced Lunch") +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c('right',
                                'top'))
```


## 5.5 Mapping Categorical Data

Mapping categorical data, also called qualitative data, is a bit more straightforward. There is no need to scale or classify data values. The goal of the color map is to provide a contrasting set of colors so as to clearly delineate different categories. Here's a point-based example:

```{r}
tm_shape(schools_sf) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'Org', 
          size = 0.15, 
          palette = 'Spectral', 
          title = "School Type")
```

## 5.6 Recap

We learned about important data driven mapping strategies and mapping concepts, including:

- Choropleth Maps
- Color Palettes
- Classification Schemes
- Point maps



Point and polygons are not the only geometry-types that we can use in data-driven mapping! You can also map linear features by associating data values with the color, shape and size of features. But these types of maps are less common.

# Exercise: Data-Driven Mapping

Practice creating choropleth and graduated color maps with the `counties` data. Pick one quantitative variable like MED_AGE and try different color palettes and classification schemes.
