# 08. Pulling it all Together

For this last lesson, we'll practice going through a full workflow!! We'll answer the question:
## What is the total grocery-store sales volume of each census tract?


### WORKFLOW:

<br>
Here's a set of steps that we will implement in the labeled cells below:

<u> 8.1 Read in and Prep Data</u>

- Read in the American Community Survey census tract joined data (created in Lesson 7)
- Read in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file of grocery store data into a standard R data.frame (it lives at `'notebook_data/other/ca_grocery_stores_2019_wgs84.csv`)
- Promote the grocery store dataframe to an `sf` data.frame with the CRS NAD83 (EPSG:4326)
- Transform the grocery store sf dataframe to match the CRS of the tracts sf dataframe
- take a peek

<u>8.2 Aggregation</u>

- Aggregate the grocery store points by tract and calculate the total grocery-store sales volume of each tract
- Don't forget to check the dimensions, contents, and any other relevant aspects of your results

<u>8.3 Plot and Review</u>

- Plot the tracts, coloring them by total grocery-store sales volume
- Plot the grocery store points on top
- Bonus points for devising a nice visualization scheme that helps you heuristically check your results!

## 8.1 Read in the Prep Data

We first need to prepare our data by loading both our tracts/acs and grocery data, and conduct our usual steps to make there they have the same CRS.

- read in our tracts acs joined data 
- read our grocery-data CSV into a plain data.frame (it lives at `'notebook_data/other/ca_grocery_stores_2019_wgs84.csv`)
- coerce it to an `sf` data.frame
- define its CRS (EPSG:4326)
- transform it to match the CRS of the tracts
- take a peek


```{r,eval=FALSE}
# read in tracts acs data

tracts_acs_ac <- st_read(...)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# read our grocery-data CSV into a plain data.frame

grocery_pts_df <- read.csv(...)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# coerce it to an `sf` data.frame, and define its CRS as 4326

grocery_pts_sf <- st_as_sf(grocery_pts_df, 
                           coords = c(...),
                           crs = ...)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# transform it to match the CRS of tracts_acs_ac

grocery_pts_sf <- st_transform(..., ...)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# take a peek

head(grocery_pts_sf)
```

# SOLUTION:

########################
# read in and prep data:
#-----------------------
# read in tracts acs data
tracts_acs_ac = st_read('outdata/tracts_acs_sdf_ac.json')
# read in the grocery-store data
grocery_pts_df = read.csv('notebook_data/other/ca_grocery_stores_2019_wgs84.csv')
# coerce to an `sf` data.frame, and define the CRS
grocery_pts_sf = st_as_sf(grocery_pts_df, 
                          coords=c('X', 'Y'),
                          crs = 4326)
# transform to our census-tract CRS
grocery_pts_sf = st_transform(grocery_pts_sf, st_crs(tracts_acs_ac))
head(grocery_pts_sf)

-----------------------

## 8.2 Aggregation

Now that we have our data and they're in the same projection, we're going to *aggregate* our data to calculate the total sales volume of each tract.

- aggregate the groceries to the tracts and calculate the total sales volume
- don't forget to check the dimensions, contents, and any other relevant aspects of your results

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# join the two datasets in such a way that you can then...

tracts_joingrocery <- st_join(..., ..., left = ..., join = ...)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# aggregate groceries by tract and calculate the total sales volume

tracts_totsalesvol <- sf:::aggregate.sf(x = ..., by = ..., FUN = ...)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# don't forget to check the dimensions, contents, and any other relevant aspects of your results

# check the dimensions
print('Dimensions of result:')
print(...)
print('Dimesions of census tracts:')
print(...)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# check the result
head(tracts_totsalesvol)
```

# SOLUTION:

############################
# spatial join and dissolve:
#---------------------------
# aggregate groceries by tract and calculate the total sales volume
tracts_totsalesvol = sf:::aggregate.sf(x = grocery_pts_sf['SALESVOL'], by = tracts_acs_ac, FUN = sum)

# check the dimensions
print('Dimensions of result:')
print(dim(tracts_totsalesvol))
print('Dimesions of census tracts:')
print(dim(tracts_acs_ac))

# check the result
head(tracts_totsalesvol)

-->

----------------------

## 8.3 Plot and Review

With any time of geospatial analysis you do, it's always nice to plot and visualize your results to check your work and start to understand the full story of your analysis.

- Plot the tracts, coloring them by total grocery-store sales volume
- Plot the grocery stores on top
- Bonus points for devising a nice visualization scheme that helps you heuristically check your results!

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# plot the tracts, coloring by total SALESVOL
final_map <- tm_shape(tracts_totsalesvol) + 
  tm_...(col = ..., 
         style = 'quantile',
         palette = 'RdYlGn',
         border.col = 'darkgrey')
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# subset the stores for only those within our tracts, to keep map within region of interest

grocery_pts_sf_ac <- st_intersection(..., ...)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# add the grocery stores, coloring by SALESVOL, for a visual check
final_map + 
  tm_shape(grocery_pts_sf_ac) + 
  tm_...(col = ..., 
         palette = ...,
         size = ...)
```

# SOLUTION:

final_map = tm_shape(tracts_totsalesvol) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'SALESVOL', style='quantile',
         palette='RdYlGn',
         border.col='darkgrey')

grocery_pts_sf_ac = st_intersection(grocery_pts_sf, tracts_totsalesvol)

final_map + 
  tm_shape(grocery_pts_sf_ac) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'SALESVOL' , palette = 'RdYlGn',
         size= 0.15)
