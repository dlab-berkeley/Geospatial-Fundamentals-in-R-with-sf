# Lesson 6. Spatial Queries

Spatial analysis is a process that begins with exploring and mapping a dataset and can lead to potentially complex models and visualizations of real world features and phenomena. `Spatial queries` are the building blocks of this analytical process. These queries are software operations that allow us to ask questions of our data and which return data metrics, subsets or new data objects.  In this lesson we explore the two basic types of spatial queries: measurement queries and relationship queries.

### Types of Spatial Queries

The basic types of **spatial queries** are:

- <u>Spatial Measurement Queries</u>
    - What is feature A's **length**?
      - *What is the length of the BART train line between Walnut Creek and Rockridge?*
    - What is feature A's **area**?
      - *What is the area of Alameda County?*
    - What is feature A's **distance** from feature B?
      - *What is the distance between Berkeley High School and Berkeley BART Station?*
    - etc.
    
- <u>Spatial Relationship Queries</u>
    - Is feature A **within** feature B?
      - *What schools are in Berkeley?*
    - Does feature A **intersect** with feature B?
      - *What in what cities is Tilden Regional Park located?
    - Does feature A **cross** feature B?
      - *Does the BART line cross into Albany?*
    - etc.

- <u>Combination Spatial Queries</u>
    - *What schools in Berkeley are within 1/4 mile of a BART station?*
    
Both measurement and relationship queries operate on the geometry of features in one or in two datasets and are dependent on the type of geometry. For example, with `point` features you can make distance measurements or ask what points are spatially inside polygon objects. But it would not make sense to compute the area of a point. Polygon features, on the other hand, allow for a wider range of both measurement and spatial relationship queries.

There are important distinctions between these two types of queries.
 - Measurement queries **always depend** on the CRS of the data while spatial relationship queries almost always do not. 
 - Measurement queries return a continuous value (e.g. area) while relationship queries evaluate to true or false, and then return the features for which the relationship is true.

### Spatial Queries are Special

We already know how to do attribute queries with our data. For example, we can select one or more specific counties by name or select those counties where the total population is greater than 100,000 because we have these columns in the dataset.

Spatial queries are special because they are dynamic. For example, we can compute area from the geometry without it already being encoded or we can select BART stations in Berkeley even if city is not encoded in the BART data by linking those two spatial datasets in the same geographic space. This dynamic query capability is extremely powerful!

In this lesson we'll work through examples of each of those types of queries.

## 6.0 Load and prep the data

Load the libraries we will use.

```{r, message=F}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(here)
```

Read in the CA Counties data and then take a look at its geometry and attributes.

```{r}
# Read in the counties shapefile
counties = st_read(dsn = here("notebook_data", 
                              "california_counties", 
                              "CaliforniaCounties.shp"))

counties <- st_make_valid(counties)

plot(counties$geometry)
```

Take a look at the spatial dataframe.

```{r}
head(counties,2)
```
#### What is the CRS of the Counties data?

- What are the units of that CRS?

#### Select just `Alameda County` and save it to a spatial dataframe

```{r}
alameda = counties[counties$NAME=='Alameda',]
plot(alameda$geometry)
```

## 6.1 Measurement Queries

We'll start off with some simple measurement queries.

We can get the area of Alameda County with the`sf` function `st_area`.

```{r}
st_area(alameda)
```

Okay! We got the area of the county in square meters. 

> `sf` uses the `units` package to manage (get and set) units.

It's more useful to return the area of large regions in square KM (or sq miles) and we can do that conversion manually by dividing by 1,000,000 (1000 * 1000):

```{r}
st_area(alameda) / 1000000
```
**BUT** the units package doesn't respond well to manual unit conversions and still reports the value as m2.

So let's try that conversion with `units`.

```{r}
units::set_units(st_area(alameda), km^2)
```

#### Now you try it! Calculate the area of Alameda County in sq miles.

- What should you change `km^2` to?
- Hint: you can take a look at [Measurement units in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/units/vignettes/measurement_units_in_R.html)
```{r}
units::set_units(st_area(alameda), km^2)  ## WHAT SHOULD YOU CHANGE IT TO?
```

#### Always check your measurements

It's a good idea to check one or two measurements before you automate your workflow to make sure you are getting valid values.  If we look up the area of Alameda county on wikipedia we get `739 sq mi (1,910 km2)`. Are the values returned by `st_area` valid? Why might they differ?

### Calculate Area for the Counties

We can also use `st_area` to add the area of all counties to the spatial dataframe.
```{r}
counties$areakm2 <- units::set_units(st_area(counties), km^2)

# take a look
head(counties)
```

### CRS and Spatial Measurements

Spatial measurements can differ greatly depending on the CRS.  Let's take a look.

```{r}
# Calculate area using data in WGS84 CRS (4326)
counties$areakm2_wgs84 <- units::set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties,4326)), km^2)

# Calculate area using data in UTM NAD83 zone 10 CRS (26910)
counties$areakm2_utm <- units::set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties,26910)), km^2)

# Calculate area using data in Web Mercator CRS (3857)
counties$areakm2_web <- units::set_units(st_area(st_transform(counties, 3857)), km^2)

# Take a look at a subset of columns only
head(counties[,c('NAME','areakm2','areakm2_wgs84','areakm2_utm','areakm2_web')])

```
Let's discuss the output.

- `CA Albers`: The CRS of our source data is an `equal area` projected CRS that is optimized for area measurements in CA. So these values in the `area_km2` column are highly accurate if the underlying geometry is.

- `WGS84`: When we computed the area based on the data transformed to WGS84 we got almost identical values. WGS84 is a geographic (unprojected) CRS with angular units expressed as decimal degrees. So why is the output accurate? Well, new versions of the `sf` package use spherical (rather than Euclidean) geometry calculations on geographic data to quickly and accurately compute area and distance. Pretty awesome!

- `UTM10`: This is a CRS optimized for Northern CA areas. So calculations outside the zone, eg SoCal, will be increasingly distorted as the area moves farther from the center of UTM zone 10N.

- `Web Mercator`: This is a CRS that preserves shape and distorts area - so not accurate at all for area calculations.

Check out the help documentation for `?st_area` for more information. But the important takeaway is that you need to use a CRS that is appropriate for your analysis/mapping needs!

When creating a spatial analysis work flow it is common to start by transforming all of your data to the same, appropriate CRS.

### Calculating Length with `st_length`

We can use the `st_length` operator in the same way to calculate the length features in a spatial dataframe. Always take note of the output units!

```{r}
# Load BART Lines
bart_lines <- st_read(here('notebook_data', 'transportation', 'bart_lines_2019.geojson'))
```
```{r}
head(bart_lines)
```

```{r}
bart_lines$len_mi <- units::set_units(st_length(bart_lines), mi)
bart_lines$len_km <- units::set_units(st_length(bart_lines), km)
head(bart_lines)
```

### Calculating Distance

The `st_distance` function can be used to find the distance between two geometries or two sets of geometries.

First let's read in the bart station data.
```{r}
bart_stations <- st_read(here('notebook_data', 'transportation','bart_stations_2019.geojson'))
head(bart_stations)
```

Compute the distance between two BART stations...
```{r}
st_distance(bart_stations[bart_stations$station_na=='Ashby',], 
                          bart_stations[bart_stations$station_na=='Downtown Berkeley',])
```

You can also use it to find the distance between multiple features.

```{r}
st_distance(bart_stations[bart_stations$station_na=='Downtown Berkeley',], bart_stations)
```

## 6.2 Spatial Relationship Queries

[Spatial relationship queries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_relation) consider how two geometries or sets of geometries relate to one another in space. For example, you may want to know what schools are located within the City of Berkeley or what East Bay Regional Parks have land within Berkeley. You may also want to combine a measurement query with a spatial relationship query. Example, you may want to know the total length of freeways within the city of Berkeley.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/TopologicSpatialRelarions2.png" height="300px"></img>

Here is a list of some of the more commonly used `sf` spatial relationship operations.

- st_intersects
- st_within 
- st_contains (the inverse of st_within)
- st_disjoint

These can be used to select features in one dataset based on their spatial relationship to another. In other works, you can use these operations to make spatial selections or create spatial subsets.

Enough talk. Let's work through some examples.

### What Alameda County Schools are in Berkeley?

First, load the `CA Places` data and select the city of Berkeley and save it to a sf dataframe. 

```{r}
places = st_read(here("notebook_data",
                      "census",
                      "Places",
                      "cb_2019_06_place_500k.shp"))

berkeley = places[places$NAME=='Berkeley',]

plot(berkeley$geometry)
```

Then, load the Alameda County schools data and make it a spatial dataframe.

```{r}
schools_df = read.csv(here("notebook_data",
                           "alco_schools.csv"))

schools_sf = st_as_sf(schools_df, 
                      coords = c('X','Y'),
                      crs = 4326)
```

Check that the two sf dataframes have the same CRS.

```{r}
st_crs(schools_sf) == st_crs(berkeley)
```

They don't have the same CRS so we need to align them. Let's transform (or reproject) the CRS of both
of these dataframes to UTM10N, NAD83 (EPSG 26910). This is a commonly used CRS for Northern CA data.
```{r}
# Transform data CRSes
schools_utm10 <- st_transform(schools_sf, 26910)
berkeley_utm10 <- st_transform(berkeley, 26910)
```

If you look at the Schools data you will see that it has a `City` column. So we can subset the data by attribute to select the Schools in Berkeley. No need to do a spatial selection. But let's do it anyway to demonstrate the process.


Assume that the schools data do not have that city column. *How can we identify the schools in Berkeley spatially?*

Here's how!

```{r}
# SPATIALLY select only the schools within Berkeley
berkeley_school = schools_utm10[berkeley_utm10, , op=st_intersects]  # NO QUOTES!!!
```

**Yes that was it! Take a long look at that simple yet powerful spatial selection syntax.**

You should interpret that syntax as:

- Select the features (i.e. rows) in the `schools_utm10` dataframe

- whose geometry **spatially intersects** the `Berkeley_utm10` geometry

- and keep all of the `schools_utm10` columns
  - *all because the extraction brackets have no second argument*
  

##### Important

The **op=st_intersects** argument is optional because `st_intersects` is the default spatial selector.

To emphasize this, let's rerun the last command.

```{r}
# SPATIALLY select only the schools within Berkeley
berkeley_schools = schools_utm10[berkeley_utm10, ]
```


#### What does `spatially intersects` mean? 

Here's one way to explain it.

> Geometry A spatially intersects Geometry B if any of its parts (e.g., a point, line segment, or polygon) is equivalent to, touches, crosses, is contained by, contains, or overlaps any part of Geometry B.

So `st_intersects` is the most general of all spatial relationships! It is also the most useful. However, you can specify any of those more specific spatial relationships by setting `op=` to any of the options listed in the `?st_intersects?` help documentation.

Let's check out the `sf` object that our selection returned.

```{r}
# How many schools did we get
dim(berkeley_schools)
```

```{r}
# Map the results
plot(berkeley_utm10$geometry)
plot(berkeley_schools$geometry, col="red", add = T)
```

> **IMPORTANT**: The default spatial selection operator is `st_intersects`.  If you want to use any other spatial operator - *and it is rare that you need to* - it must be specified.

For example, we can use the `st_disjoint` operator to select only those schools **NOT** in Berkeley. 

```{r}
# Select all Alameda County Schools NOT in Berkeley with the disjoint operator
berkeley_schools_disjoint = schools_utm10[berkeley_utm10, , op = st_disjoint]

# Plot the result
plot(berkeley_schools_disjoint$geometry)
plot(berkeley_utm10, 
     col = NA, 
     border = "red", 
     add = T)
```

There is no need to memorize these spatial operators (aka predicates)! [Here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf) is a fantastic `sf` cheatsheet that lists and briefly explains all these common functions (and many more).


--------------------------------

### Protected Areas in Alameda County

Let's load a new dataset, the CA Protected Areas Database (CPAD), to demonstrate these spatial queries in more detail.

This dataset contains all of the protected areas (parks and the like) in California.

We will use this data and the Alameda County census tract data that we created earlier to ask, "What protected areas are within Alameda County?"

First load the CPAD data.
```{r}
cpad <- st_read(here("notebook_data",
                     "protected_areas",
                     "CPAD_2020a_Units.shp"))
```

What is the CRS of the CPAD data?

Let's transform the CRS of the CPAD data to match that used by the `alameda` data (CA Albers).

```{r}
st_crs(cpad) == st_crs(alameda)
```

Let's plot the data in so that we know what to expect. CPAD is big, so wait for it...
```{r}
plot(alameda$geometry, col = 'grey', border = "grey")
plot(cpad$geometry, col = 'green', add = T)
```

We can see from our map that some of the protected areas are `completely within` Alameda County, some of them `overlap`, and some are `completely outside` of the county. To get both of the "inside" and "overlaps" cases we use the `st_intersects` spatial selection operator, which is the default. Let's check it out.

```{r}
cpad_intersects <- cpad[alameda,]  # st_intersects
cpad_within <- cpad[alameda, , op = st_within] # st_within
```

We can use `tmap` to explore the difference in the results from `st_intersects` vs `st_within`
```{r}
tmap_mode('view')

tm_shape(alameda) +
  tm_polygons(col = "gray", 
              border.col = "grey") +
tm_shape(cpad_intersects) +
  tm_borders(col = "green") +
tm_shape(cpad_within) +
  tm_borders(col = 'red')
```

Use the tmap `layer control` to toggle the intersects and within results and examine them more closely.

What you can see from the above, is that by default, `st_intersects` returns the features that intersect but it does not **clip** the features to the boundary of Alameda County. For that, we would need to use a different spatial operation - `st_intersection`.

Let's try it!

```{r}
cpad_in_ac <- st_intersection(cpad, alameda)
```

Great! Now, if we scroll the resulting `sf` object we'll see that 
the `COUNTY` column of our resulting subset gives us a good sanity check on our results. Or does it?

```{r}
table(cpad_in_ac$COUNTY)
```

Always check your output - both the attribute table & the geometry!

```{r}
head(cpad_in_ac)
```

Let's also use an overlay plot to check the output geometry.

```{r}
tm_shape(alameda) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'gray', 
              border.col = 'gray') +
tm_shape(cpad_in_ac) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'ACRES', 
              palette = 'YlGn',
              border.col = 'black', 
              lwd = 0.4, 
              alpha = 0.8,
              title =  'Protected areas in Alameda County, colored by area')
```

### st_intersects or st_intersection?

It really depends! But make sure you understand the difference. 

`st_intersects` is a logical operator that returns `true` if two geometries intersect in any way. When used to subset (or filter) a spatial dataframe, `st_intersects` returns those features in a dataframe that intersect with the filter dataframe.  

On the other hand, `st_intersection` returns a new spatial dataframe that is the set intersection of the two dataframes, including both the geometries and attributes of the intersecting features. Use `st_intersection` with caution and always check your results.

## Exercise: Spatial Relationship Query

It's your turn.

Write a spatial relationship query to create a new dataset containing only the BART stations in Berkeley.

We already have these two datasets loaded as `bart_stations` and  `berkeley_utm`.

Check the CRS of the two layers and plot these two datasets in an overlay map.  If you need to transform the CRS of the bart_stations, make them match the CRS of    berkeley_utm.

Then, write your own code to:
1. Spatially select the BART stations that are `within` Berkeley
2. Plot the Berkeley boundary and then overlay the selected BART stations.

```{r}
# Check CRS of bart_stations
st_crs(bart_stations)

#transform bart stations to make berkeley_utm10
bart_utm10 = st_transform(bart_stations, st_crs(berkeley_utm10))

```

Plot the data together

```{r}
plot(bart_utm10$geometry)
plot(berkeley_utm10$geometry, border = 'blue', add=T)
```

#### Your code here!

Now, in the cell below, `write the code` to spatially select the Berkeley BART stations, then make the map.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE:

# Spatially select the BART stations within Berkeley

# Plot the Bart stations in Berkeley overlaid on top of the Berkeley City Boundary

```

## 6.3 Proximity Analysis

Now that we've seen the basic idea of spatial measurement and spatial relationship queries,
let's take a look at a common analysis that combines those concepts: **promximity analysis**.

Proximity analysis seeks to identify **near** features - or, in other words, all features in a focal feature set
that are within some maximum distance of features in a reference feature set.

A very common workflow for this analysis is:

1. Buffer around the features in the reference dataset to create buffer polygons.

2. Run a spatial relationship query to find all focal features that intersect (or are within) the buffer polygons.

---------------------------------

Let's read in our bike boulevard data again.

Then we'll find out which of our Berkeley schools are within a block's distance (200 meters) of the bike boulevards.

```{r}
bike_blvds <- st_read(here("notebook_data",
                           "transportation",
                           "BerkeleyBikeBlvds.geojson"))
plot(bike_blvds$geometry)
```

Of course, we need to reproject the boulevards to our projected CRS.

```{r}
bike_blvds_utm10 = st_transform(bike_blvds, st_crs(berkeley_utm10))
```

Now we can create our 200 meter bike boulevard buffers.

```{r}
bike_blvds_buf = st_buffer(bike_blvds_utm10, dist = 200)
```

Now let's overlay everything.

```{r}
tm_shape(berkeley_utm10) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'lightgrey') + 
tm_shape(bike_blvds_buf) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'pink', alpha = 0.5) +
tm_shape(bike_blvds_utm10) + 
  tm_lines() + 
tm_shape(berkeley_schools) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'purple', size = 0.2)
```

Great! Looks like we're all ready to run our spatial relationship query to complete the proximity analysis. At this point (pun intended) select the schools that are in within the bike boulevard buffer polygons.

```{r}
schools_near_blvds = berkeley_schools[bike_blvds_buf, ]

# or
#schools_near_blvds = berkeley_schools[bike_blvds_buf, , op = 'st_within']

```


Now let's overlay again, to see if the schools we selected make sense.

```{r}
tm_shape(berkeley_utm10) + 
  tm_borders() + 
  
# add the bike blvd buffer polygons  
tm_shape(bike_blvds_buf) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'pink', alpha = 0.5) +

# add the bike blvd line features  
tm_shape(bike_blvds_utm10) + 
  tm_lines(lwd=2) + 

# add all berkeley schools  
tm_shape(berkeley_schools) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'purple', size = 0.2) +

# add schools near bike boulevards in yellow
tm_shape(schools_near_blvds) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'yellow', size = 0.2)
```


### Leveling up!

You can use `st_distance` and its companion function `st_nearest_feature` to compute the distance between each feature and the **nearest** bike boulevard.  The `st_nearest_feature` function returns the ID of the closest feature.

```{r}
# Identify the nearest bike boulevard for each school
nearest_blvd = st_nearest_feature(berkeley_schools, bike_blvds_utm10)

# take a look!
nearest_blvd
```
To repeat, the `st_nearest_feature` function returns the ID of the closest feature. These are stored in `nearest_blvd`.

Then we can calculate the distance between each school and it's nearest bike boulevard.

```{r}
berkeley_schools$bike_blvd_dist <- st_distance(berkeley_schools, 
                                              bike_blvds_utm10[nearest_blvd,], 
                                              by_element = TRUE)

#take alook
berkeley_schools[order(berkeley_schools$bike_blvd_dist),]
```

## Exercise: Proximity Analysis

Now it's your turn to try out a proximity analysis!

Write your own code to find all BERKELEY schools within walking distance (1 km) of a BART station.

As a reminder, let's break this into steps:

1. Spatially select the BART stations in Berkeley from the `bart_utm10` dataframe
2. Buffer your Berkeley BART stations to 1 km (**HINT**: remember your units!)
2. Spatially select the schools within walking distance to the Berkeley BART stations.
3. As always, plot your results for a good visual check!

To see the solution, look at the hidden text below.

#### Your code here

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE:

# spatially select the Berkeley BART stations 
# # (You may have done this in a previous exercise.)

# buffer the BART stations to 1 km

# spatially select the schools within the buffers

# map your results with tmap
# # plot the Berkeley boundary (for reference) in lightgrey

# add the BART stations (for reference) to the plot in green

# add the BART buffers (for check) in lightgreen

# add all Berkeley schools (for reference) in black

# add the schools near BART (for check) in yellow

```

## 6.4 Recap
Leveraging what we've learned in our earlier lessons, we got to work with map overlays and start answering questions related to proximity. Key concepts include:

- Measuring area and length
	- `st_area`, 
	- `st_length`
	- `st_distance`
- Spatial relationship queries
	- `st_intersects`, 
	- `st_intersection`
	- `st_within`, etc.
- Buffer analysis
	- `st_buffer`
