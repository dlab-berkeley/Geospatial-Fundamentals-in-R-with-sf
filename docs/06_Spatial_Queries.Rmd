# Lesson 6. Spatial Queries

Spatial analysis is a process that begins with exploring and mapping a dataset and can lead to potentially complex models and visualizations of real world features and phenomena. `Spatial queries` are the building blocks of this analytical process. These queries are software operations that allow us to ask questions of our data and which return data metrics, subsets or new data objects.  In this lesson we explore the two basic types of spatial queries: measurement queries and relationship queries.

### Types of Spatial Queries

The basic types of **spatial queries** are:

- <u>Measurement queries</u>
    - What is feature A's **length**?
    - What is feature A's **perimeter**?
    - What is feature A's **area**?
    - What is feature A's **distance** from feature B?
    - etc.
    
- <u>Relationship queries</u>
    - Does feature A **intersect** with feature B?
    - Is feature A **within** feature B?
    - Does feature A **cross** feature B?
    - etc.

Both of these types of queries operate on the geometry of features in one or two datasets and are dependent on the type of geometry. For example, with `point` features you can make distance measurements or ask what points are spatially inside polygon objects. Polygon features, on the other hand, allow for a wider range of both measurement and spatial relationship queries.

An important distinction between these two types of queries is that measurement queries depend on the CRS of the data while spatial relationship queries do not. This is because `topological relationships`, the term used to describe spatial relationships, are invariant to rotation, translation and scaling transformations like those that CRS transformations entail.

### Attribute vs. Spatial Queries

We already know how to do attribute queries with our data. For example, we can select one or more specific counties by name or select those counties where the total population is greater than 100,000 because we have these columns in the dataset.

Spatial queries are special because they are dynamic. For example, we can compute area from the geometry without it already being encoded or we can select BART stations in Berkeley even if city is not encoded in the BART data by linking those two spatial datasets in the same geographic space. This dynamic query capability is extremely powerful!

In this lesson we'll work through examples of each of those types of queries.

Then we'll try a very common spatial analysis method that 
is a conceptual amalgam of those two types: **proximity analysis**.


## 6.0 Load and prep the data

Load the libraries we will use.

```{r, message=F}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(here)
```

Read in the CA census tracts data and then take a look at its geometry and attributes.

```{r}
census_tracts = st_read(here("notebook_data",
                             "census",
                             "Tracts",
                             "cb_2019_06_tract_500k.shp"))

plot(census_tracts$geometry)
```

```{r}
head(census_tracts)
```

Select just the `Alameda County` census tracts.

```{r}
census_tracts_ac = census_tracts[census_tracts$COUNTYFP=='001',]
plot(census_tracts_ac)
```

## 6.1 Measurement Queries

We'll start off with some simple measurement queries.

We can get the area of each of our census tracts using the`sf` function `st_area`.

```{r}
st_area(census_tracts_ac)[1:10]
```

Okay! 

We got... 

numbers!

...?

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Question**

1. What do those numbers mean?
2. What are the units?
3. And if we're not sure, how might be find out?


Let's take a look at our CRS.

```{r}
st_crs(census_tracts_ac)
```

Wow! We're working with data that are in what is called an `unprojected` CRS. That means that the coordinates are latitude and longitude values and the units are decimal degrees. However, the `sf::st_area` function automatically returned area measurements in square meters (rather than in square degrees, which don't make sense.)

How did it do this? Well, you can check out the help documentation for `?st_area` for more information. If the data have a projected CRS, `st_area` uses Euclidean geometry to return area measurements in the units of the CRS. For an unprojected CRS, `st_area` calculates geodetic area on a curved surface model of the Earth and returns measurements in square meters. Pretty cool and pretty useful right?  

------------------

**That said, when doing spatial analysis, we will almost always want to convert all of our data to the same projected CRS since many spatial operations do not work with geographic CRSs.**

Time to project! We'll transform the data to the `UTM Zone 10N, NAD83 CRS (EPSG 26910)` which is appropriate for Northern California location data and is highly accurate for measurement queries for areas within the zone.

<img src="https://www.xmswiki.com/images/2/23/Usutm.png" width="600px"></img>

```{r}
#Transform CRS of census tract data
census_tracts_ac_utm10 = st_transform(census_tracts_ac, 26910)
```

Now check it..especially look for the units.
```{r}
st_crs(census_tracts_ac_utm10)
```

Now let's try our area calculation again.

```{r}
st_area(census_tracts_ac_utm10)[1:10]
```

What if we compare areas calculated with our unprojected and projected CRS data?

```{r}
# Using format to make for easier to read display
print(format(st_area(census_tracts_ac)[[1]], big.mark = ','))
print(format(st_area(census_tracts_ac_utm10)[[1]], big.mark = ","))
```

Hmmm... The numbers are a bit different...specifically...

```{r}
format((st_area(census_tracts_ac)[[1]] - st_area(census_tracts_ac_utm10)[[1]]),
       digits = 0, 
       big.mark = ',')
```

----------------------------

You may have noticed that our census tracts already have an area column in them.

Let's also compare the calculated areas with the data in this column.

```{r}
print(st_area(census_tracts_ac)[[1]])
print(st_area(census_tracts_ac_utm10)[[1]])
print(census_tracts$ALAND[1])
```

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Question**

What explains the discrepancy? Which areas are correct? Which are incorrect?

#### Doing more

We can also calculate the area for Alameda county summing the areas of all census tracts.

```{r}
sum(st_area(census_tracts_ac_utm10))
```

We can look up how large Alameda County is to check our work.The county is 739 miles<sup>2</sup>, which is around 1,914,001,213 meters<sup>2</sup>. I'd say we're pretty close!

```{r}
# Sum the area of all Alameda county Census Tracts dynamically in square miles...
sum(units::set_units(st_area(census_tracts_ac_utm10), mi^2))
```

Calculating the area of all features and adding the output to the dataframe is a useful operation because it allows us to convert count variables like population to densities.

```{r}
# Add the area of all Alameda County Census tracts to the data frame
census_tracts_ac_utm10$area_sqmi <- units::set_units(st_area(census_tracts_ac_utm10), mi^2)

# Check it by summing
print(sum(census_tracts_ac_utm10$area_sqmi))

# Take a look
head(census_tracts_ac_utm10,3)
```


------------

You may be wondering how R is managing the units of our measurements.

It turns out that `sf` depends on the `units` package to track units. 

This is super convenient! But there is a gotcha:

```{r}
# convert to square kilometers
sum(st_area(census_tracts_ac_utm10)) / (1000^2)
```

Oops! Our manual conversion to square kilometers gave us the right number but kept the now-wrong units!

Here's the proper way to convert:

```{r}
units::set_units(sum(st_area(census_tracts_ac_utm10)), km^2)
```

Much nicer! In case you're wondering how we knew the right abbreviation to use for kilometers,
check out the leftmost column in this reference table:

```{r}
# View(units::valid_udunits())
```

### Calculating Length or Permeter

We can use the `st_length` operator in the same way to calculate the length or perimeter of features. Always take note of the output units!

```{r}
st_length(census_tracts)[1:10]
```

### Calculating Distance

The `st_distance` function can be used to find the pairwise distance between two sets of geometries.
```{r}
st_distance(census_tracts_ac_utm10, census_tracts_ac_utm10)[1:5,1:5]
```

You can also use it to find the distance between specific features.
```{r}
# Identify my tracts of interest
mytracts = c('4201','4202','4203','4204')
# What is the distance between tract 4201 and all other tracts
st_distance(census_tracts_ac_utm10[census_tracts_ac_utm10$NAME=='4101',],
            census_tracts_ac_utm10[census_tracts_ac_utm10$NAME %in% mytracts,] )
```

## 6.2 Spatial Relationship Queries

[Spatial relationship queries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_relation) consider how two geometries or sets of geometries relate to one another in space. For example, you may want to know what schools are located within the City of Berkeley or what East Bay Regional Parks have land within Berkeley. You may also want to combine a measurement query with a spatial relationship query. Example, you may want to know the total length of freeways within the city of Berkeley.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/TopologicSpatialRelarions2.png" height="300px"></img>

Here is a list of some of the more commonly used `sf` spatial relationship operations.

- st_intersects
- st_within
- st_contains
- st_disjoint

These can be used to select features in one dataset based on their spatial relationship to another. In other works, you can use these operations to make spatial selections / create spatial subsets.

Enough talk. Let's work through some examples.

### What Alameda County Schools are in Berkeley?

First, load the `CA Places` data and select the city of Berkeley and save it to a sf dataframe. 

```{r}
places = st_read(here("notebook_data",
                      "census",
                      "Places",
                      "cb_2019_06_place_500k.shp"))

berkeley = places[places$NAME=='Berkeley',]

plot(berkeley$geometry)
```

Then, load the Alameda County schools data and make it a spatial dataframe.

```{r}
schools_df = read.csv(here("notebook_data",
                           "alco_schools.csv"))

schools_sf = st_as_sf(schools_df, 
                      coords = c('X','Y'),
                      crs = 4326)
```

Check that the two sf dataframes have the same CRS.

```{r}
st_crs(schools_sf) == st_crs(berkeley)
```

They don't have the same CRS so we need to align them. Let's transform (or reproject) the CRS of both
of these dataframes to UTM10N, NAD83 (EPSG 26910). This is a commonly used CRS for Northern CA data.
```{r}
# Transform data CRSes
schools_utm10 <- st_transform(schools_sf, 26910)
berkeley_utm10 <- st_transform(berkeley, 26910)
```

If you look at the Schools data you will see that it has a `City` column. So we can subset the data by attribute to select the Schools in Berkeley. No need to do a spatial selection.

```{r}
berkeley_schools = schools_utm10[schools_utm10$City == 'Berkeley', ]
dim(berkeley_schools)
```

Confirm the results by plotting the data
```{r}
plot(berkeley_utm10$geometry)
plot(berkeley_schools$geometry, add = T)
```

That looks good and was a relatively simple operation. But what if the schools data didn't have that city column or if only some of the rows had a value in that column. *How can we identify the schools in Berkeley spatially?*

Here's how!

```{r}
# SPATIALLY select only the schools within Berkeley
berkeley_schools_spatial = schools_utm10[berkeley_utm10, , op = st_intersects]  # NO QUOTES!!!
```

**Yes that was it! Take a long look at that simple yet powerful spatial selection syntax.**

You should interpret that syntax as:

- "Select all features (i.e. rows) in the `schools_utm10` dataframe:

  - **schools_utm10**[berkeley_utm10, , op=st_intersects]
  
  
- and all of the columns:  

  - schools_utm10[berkeley_utm10 **, ,** op=st_intersects]
  
  (*all because the extraction brackets have no second argument*)
  
- whose geometry **spatially intersects** the Berkeley_utm10 geometry

  - schools_utm10[berkeley_utm10, , **op=st_intersects**]

##### Important

The **op=st_intersects** argument is optional because `st_intersects` is the default spatial selector.

To emphasize this, let's rerun the last command.

```{r}
# SPATIALLY select only the schools within Berkeley
berkeley_schools_spatial = schools_utm10[berkeley_utm10, ]
```


#### What does `spatiallly intersects` mean? 

Here's one way to explain it.

> Geometry A spatially intersects Geometry B if any of its parts (e.g., a point, line segment, or polygon) is equivalent to, touches, crosses, is contained by, contains, or overlaps any part of Geometry B.

So `st_intersects` is the mother of all spatial relationships! It is the most general and the most useful. However, you can specify any of those more specific spatial relationships by setting `op=` to any of the options listed in the `?st_intersects?` help documentation.

Let's check out the `sf` object that our selection returned.

```{r}
# How many schools did we get
dim(berkeley_schools_spatial)
```

```{r}
# Map the results
plot(berkeley_utm10$geometry)
plot(berkeley_schools_spatial$geometry, add = T)
```

Interestingly, we have one more school in Berkeley based on the spatial selection!? Let's take a look.

```{r}
plot(berkeley_utm10$geometry)
plot(berkeley_schools_spatial$geometry, add = T)
plot(berkeley_schools$geometry, col="red", add = T)
```

Let's use an interactive `tmap` to zoom into the school that was not selected by attribute but was spatially selected.

```{r}
tmap_mode('view')

tm_shape(berkeley_utm10) +
  tm_borders() +
  tm_shape(berkeley_schools_spatial) +
  tm_dots(col = "black", size = 0.3) +
  tm_shape(berkeley_schools) +
  tm_dots(col = "red", size = 0.1)
```

> **IMPORTANT**: The default spatial selection operator is `st_intersects`.  If you want to use any other operator, it must be specified.

For example, we can use the `st_disjoint` operator to select only those schools **NOT** in Berkeley. 

```{r}
# Select all Alameda County Schools NOT in Berkeley with the disjoint operator
berkeley_schools_disjoint = schools_utm10[berkeley_utm10, , op = st_disjoint]

# Plot the result
plot(berkeley_schools_disjoint$geometry)
plot(berkeley_utm10, 
     col = NA, 
     border = "red", 
     add = T)
```

There is no need to memorize these spatial operators (aka predicates)! [Here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf) is a fantastic `sf` cheatsheet that lists and briefly explains all these common functions (and many more).


--------------------------------

### Protected Areas in Alameda County

Let's load a new dataset, the CA Protected Areas Database (CPAD), to demonstrate these spatial queries in more detail.

This dataset contains all of the protected areas (parks and the like) in California.

We will use this data and the Alameda County census tract data that we created earlier to ask, "What protected areas are within Alameda County?"

First load the CPAD data.
```{r}
cpad <- st_read(here("notebook_data",
                     "protected_areas",
                     "CPAD_2020a_Units.shp"))
```

What is the CRS of the CPAD data?

Let's transform the data to match `census_tracts_ac_utm10`.

```{r}
cpad_utm10 <- st_transform(cpad, st_crs(census_tracts_ac_utm10))
```

Let's plot the data in so that we know what to expect. CPAD is big, so wait for it...
```{r}
plot(census_tracts_ac_utm10$geometry, col = 'grey', border = "grey")
plot(cpad_utm10$geometry, col = 'green', add = T)
```

We can see from our map that some of the protected areas are completely within Alameda County, some of them overlap, and some are completely outside of the county. To get both of the "inside" and "overlaps" cases we use the `st_intersects` spatial selection operator, which is the default. Let's check it out.

```{r}
cpad_intersects <- cpad_utm10[census_tracts_ac_utm10,]  # st_intersects
cpad_within <- cpad_utm10[census_tracts_ac_utm10, , op = st_within] # st_within
```

We can use `tmap` to explore the difference in the results from `st_intersects` vs `st_within`
```{r}
tmap_mode('view')

tm_shape(census_tracts_ac_utm10) +
  tm_polygons(col = "gray", 
              border.col = "grey") +
tm_shape(cpad_intersects) +
  tm_borders(col = "green") +
tm_shape(cpad_within) +
  tm_borders(col = 'red')
```

What you can see from the above, is that by default, `st_intersects` returns the features that intersect but it does not **clip** the features to the boundary of Alameda County. For that, we would need to use a different spatial operation - `st_intersection`.

Let's try it!

```{r}
cpad_in_ac <- st_intersection(cpad_utm10, census_tracts_ac_utm10)
```

Great! Now, if we scroll the resulting `sf` object we'll see that 
the `COUNTY` column of our resulting subset gives us a good sanity check on our results. Or does it?

```{r}
table(cpad_in_ac$COUNTY)
```

Always check your output - both the attribute table & the geometry!

```{r}
head(cpad_in_ac)
```

Let's also use an overlay plot to check the output geometry.

```{r}
tm_shape(census_tracts_ac_utm10) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'gray', 
              border.col = 'gray') +
tm_shape(cpad_in_ac) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'ACRES', 
              palette = 'YlGn',
              border.col = 'black', 
              lwd = 0.4, 
              alpha = 0.8,
              title =  'Protected areas in Alameda County, colored by area')
```

### st_intersects or st_intersection?

It really depends! But make sure you understand the difference. 

`st_intersects` is a logical operator that returns `True` if two geometries intersect in any way. When used to subset (or filter) a spatial dataframe, `st_intersects` returns those features in the dataframe that intersect with the filter dataframe.  

On the other hand, `st_intersection` returns a new spatial dataframe that set intersection of the two dataframes, including both the geometries and attributes of the intersecting features. Use `st_intersection` with caution and always check your results.

## Exercise: Spatial Relationship Query

It's your turn.

Write a spatial relationship query to create a new dataset containing only the BART stations in Berkeley.

Run the next two cells to (1) load the dataset containing Berkeley BART stations and then reproject it to the same CRS as that used by the Berkeley_utm10 dataframe (EPSG: 26910)' (2) plot these two datasets in an overlay map.

Then, write your own code to:
1. Spatially select the BART stations that are `within` Berkeley
2. Plot the Berkeley boundary and then overlay the selected BART stations.


```{r}
# load the Berkeley boundary
bart_df = st_read(here("notebook_data",
                       "transportation",
                       "bart.csv"))

bart_sf = st_as_sf(bart_df, 
                   coords = c('lon', 'lat'),
                   crs = 4326)
  
# transform to EPSG:26910
bart_utm10 = st_transform(bart_sf, st_crs(berkeley_utm10))

# display
head(berkeley_utm10)
```

Plot the data together

```{r}
plot(bart_utm10$geometry)
plot(berkeley_utm10$geometry, border = 'blue', add = T)
```

#### Your code here!

Now, in the cell below, `write the code` to spatially select the Berkeley BART stations, then make the map.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE:

# Spatially select the BART stations within Berkeley

# Plot the Bart stations in Berkeley overlaid on top of the Berkeley City Boundary

```

# plot the Berkeley border

  tm_polygons(col='lightgrey') + 
  
tm_shape(bart_in_berkeley) + 
  tm_dots(col='purple', size=0.1)

## 6.3 Proximity Analysis

Now that we've seen the basic idea of spatial measurement and spatial relationship queries,
let's take a look at a common analysis that combines those concepts: **promximity analysis**.

Proximity analysis seeks to identify **near** features - or, in other words, all features in a focal feature set
that are within some maximum distance of features in a reference feature set.

A very common workflow for this analysis is:

1. Buffer around the features in the reference dataset to create buffer polygons.

2. Run a spatial relationship query to find all focal features that intersect (or are within) the buffer polygons.

---------------------------------

Let's read in our bike boulevard data again.

Then we'll find out which of our Berkeley schools are within a block's distance (200 meters) of the bike boulevards.

```{r}
bike_blvds <- st_read(here("notebook_data",
                           "transportation",
                           "BerkeleyBikeBlvds.geojson"))
plot(bike_blvds$geometry)
```

Of course, we need to reproject the boulevards to our projected CRS.

```{r}
bike_blvds_utm10 = st_transform(bike_blvds, st_crs(berkeley_utm10))
```

Now we can create our 200 meter bike boulevard buffers.

```{r}
bike_blvds_buf = st_buffer(bike_blvds_utm10, dist = 200)
```

Now let's overlay everything.

```{r}
tm_shape(berkeley_utm10) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'lightgrey') + 
tm_shape(bike_blvds_buf) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'pink', alpha = 0.5) +
tm_shape(bike_blvds_utm10) + 
  tm_lines() + 
tm_shape(berkeley_schools_spatial) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'purple', size = 0.2)
```

Great! Looks like we're all ready to run our spatial relationship query to complete the proximity analysis. At this point (pun intended) select the schools that are in within the bike boulevard buffer polygons.

```{r}
schools_near_blvds = berkeley_schools_spatial[bike_blvds_buf, ]

# or
#schools_near_blvds = berkeley_schools_spatial[bike_blvds_buf, , op = 'st_within']

```


Now let's overlay again, to see if the schools we selected make sense.

```{r}
tm_shape(berkeley_utm10) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'lightgrey') + 
  
# add the bike blvd buffer polygons  
tm_shape(bike_blvds_buf) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'pink', alpha = 0.5) +

# add the bike blvd line features  
tm_shape(bike_blvds_utm10) + 
  tm_lines() + 

# add all berkeley schools  
tm_shape(berkeley_schools_spatial) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'purple', size = 0.2) +

# add schools near bike boulevards in yellow
tm_shape(schools_near_blvds) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'yellow', size = 0.2)
```


### Leveling up!

You can use `st_distance` and its companion function `st_nearest_feature` to compute the distance between each feature and the **nearest** bike boulevard.  The `st_nearest_feature` function returns the ID of the closest feature.

```{r}
# Identify the nearest bike boulevard for each school
nearest = st_nearest_feature(berkeley_schools_spatial, bike_blvds_utm10)

# take a look!
nearest
```

Then we can calculate the distance between each school and it's nearest bike boulevard.

```{r}
st_distance(berkeley_schools_spatial, 
            bike_blvds_utm10[nearest,], 
            by_element = TRUE)
```

## Exercise: Proximity Analysis

Now it's your turn to try out a proximity analysis!

Write your own code to find all BERKELEY schools within walking distance (1 km) of a BART station.

As a reminder, let's break this into steps:

1. Spatially select the BART stations in Berkeley from the `bart_utm10` dataframe
2. Buffer your Berkeley BART stations to 1 km (**HINT**: remember your units!)
2. Spatially select the schools within walking distance to the Berkeley BART stations.
3. As always, plot your results for a good visual check!

To see the solution, look at the hidden text below.

#### Your code here

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE:

# spatially select the Berkeley BART stations 
# # (You may have done this in a previous exercise.)

# buffer the BART stations to 1 km

# spatially select the schools within the buffers

# map your results with tmap
# # plot the Berkeley boundary (for reference) in lightgrey

# add the BART stations (for reference) to the plot in green

# add the BART buffers (for check) in lightgreen

# add all Berkeley schools (for reference) in black

# add the schools near BART (for check) in yellow

```

# SOLUTION

# spatially subset to select the Berkeley BART stations
berkeley_bart <- bart_utm10[berkeley_utm10,]

# buffer your Berkeley BART stations to 1 km (**HINT**: remember your units!)
bart_buf <- st_buffer(berkeley_bart, 1000)

# spatially select the schools within walking distance to the Berkeley BART stations
schools_near_bart <- schools_utm10[bart_buf,]

# map results with tmap

# plot the Berkeley boundary (for reference)
tm_shape(berkeley_utm10) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'lightgrey') + 
  
# plot the BART stations (for reference)
tm_shape(berkeley_bart) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'green', size = 0.1) + 

# add the BART buffers (for check)
tm_shape(bart_buf) + 
  tm_borders(col = 'lightgreen') + 

# add all Berkeley schools (for reference)
tm_shape(berkeley_schools) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'black', size = 0.1) + 

# add the schools near BART (for check)
tm_shape(schools_near_bart) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'yellow', size = 0.25)

## 6.4 Recap
Leveraging what we've learned in our earlier lessons, we got to work with map overlays and start answering questions related to proximity. Key concepts include:

- Measuring area and length
	- `st_area`, 
	- `st_length`
	- `st_distance`
- Spatial relationship queries
	- `st_intersects`, 
	- `st_intersection`
	- `st_within`, etc.
- Buffer analysis
	- `st_buffer`
