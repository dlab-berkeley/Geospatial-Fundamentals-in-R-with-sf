# Lesson 4. More Data, More Maps!

Now that we know how to pull in data, check and transform Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS), and plot `sf` data.frames together - let's practice doing the same thing with other geometry types. In this notebook we'll be bringing in bike boulevards and schools, which will get us primed to think about spatial relationship queries.

### Import Libraries

```{r, message=F}
library(sf)
library(here)
```

#### Load some data
```{r}
counties = st_read(here("notebook_data",
                        "california_counties",
                        "CaliforniaCounties.shp"))

ca_places = st_read(here("notebook_data",
                         "census",
                         "Places",
                         "cb_2019_06_place_500k.shp"))
```

## Mapping `sf` objects

Just like with other plots we can make in R, we can customize our maps' colors, title, etc.

The most basic way to do this would be to use the `sf::plot` function.

```{r}
# Make a map with plot
plot(counties$geometry, col='tan', border='darkgreen', main="CA counties")
```


However, we'll get much more functionality and customizability if we use a special-purpose mapping package, rather than just relying on `sf` methods of base R functions.

## R packages for Mapping `sf` objects

There are many different packages you can use to make maps of `sf` data, including:

- `ggplot2`: which is fantastic if you are already a ggplot user
- `mapview`: for a quick and easy interactive map
- `tmap`: for great custom static and interactive maps
- `leaflet`: for highly custom interactive maps that you can output and host on a website
- `shiny`: for interactive R based applications that use leaflet maps

We won't cover leaflet or shiny, but we will present an quick look at ggplot2 and mapview and then dive into tmap.

### Maps with ggplot

Here is a simple example of a ggplot map syntax. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(counties, aes(fill = MED_AGE)) + 
  geom_sf() +  # tells ggplot that geographic data are being plotted
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "2010 Median Age by County")
```

### Maps with `mapview`

The `mapview` package is the easiest way to make a basic interactive map with very little code. 

- See the documentation (?mapview) or webpage (https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview) for more info.

```{r, eval=F}
library(mapview)

# Interactive map of counties
mapview(counties)

# with areas colored by data values
mapview(counties, zcol = 'MED_AGE')

# and overlaying CA Places data
mapview(counties, zcol = 'MED_AGE') + mapview(ca_places)

```
Mapview is great for exploring your data. Less great for making pretty custom maps.

## 4.2 Mapping with `tmap`

Our go-to mapping package of choice is [`tmap`](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap). Its name stands for "thematic maps", i.e. maps in which we use attributes of our dataset to control the visualization parameters of our maps, thus creating effective data visualizations. 

`tmap` is great for creating both static and interactive maps.

You'll get plenty of introduction here in the workshop, but for additional support you can check out the [tmap vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html) or Google other tutorials and references.

Let's start by loading the package and creating a 'quick tmap'.

```{r}
# load tmap
library(tmap)

# make tmap fix broken polygons
tmap_options(check.and.fix = TRUE)

# plot a 'quick tmap'
qtm(counties)
```

Nice!

That's the quickest, simplest example of a static map that `tmap` can make. 

### Toggling `tmap` modes

`tmap` has 2 modes:

- Use `tmap_mode('plot')` to set the mapping mode for static maps

- Use `tmap_mode('view')` to set the mapping mode for interactive maps

- use `ttm()` to quickly toggle between modes

`tmap` loads up in 'plot' mode. Let's switch it to 'view' mode and then take a look at that same map. 


```{r}
# toggle the mode
ttm()
```

```{r}
# then make our quick tmap again
qtm(counties)
```
That's outstanding! We get a clickable, scrollable, zoomable map built in Javascript's Leaflet package... right out of the box!

- You can change the **basemap** using the `Layer Control` under the `Zoom Controls`.

And to create thematic maps, we can use `tmap`'s more verbose mapping functions to create a new `tmap` object and then add geometry layers to it, setting different aesthetic aspects of those layers.

For now, let's recreate that same map we made above with `plot`, but this time using `tmap` syntax:

```{r}
tm_shape(counties) +  # use the `tm_shape` function to create a tmap object
  tm_polygons(col = 'tan', # add `tm_polygons` layer, coloring as before
              border.col = 'darkgreen', 
              alpha = 0.5) # & making transparent
```

Above, `tm_shape` creates the new `tmap` object by identifying the data source for the first map layer (`counties`).  Then, `tm_polygons` provides the aesthetics for how the data should be displayed.

- If we only want to display the polygon outlines we would use `tm_borders` instead of `tm_polygons`:

```{r}
tm_shape(counties) +  # use the `tm_shape` function to create a tmap object
  tm_borders(col = 'darkgreen', 
             alpha = 0.85) 
```



Now we have two primary mapping tools:

    - `plot`: nice for simple, pared down plotting tasks
    - `tmap`: quick maps, both static and interactive, with greater flexibility
    
## 4.3 More Data, More Maps!

In this section we are going to bring in some new data for mapping

- Berkeley Bike Boulevards
- Alameda County Schools

First, we will read in the Berkeley bike boulevards in data. Note two things that are different from our previous data:

- We're reading in data from a [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) file and not a shapefile

- The data have **line** geometry (our county and states data had **polygon** geometries)

```{r}
bike_blvds = st_read(here("notebook_data",
                          "transportation",
                          "BerkeleyBikeBlvds.geojson"))

plot(bike_blvds$geometry)
```

Of course, we could also use `tmap` to plot our lines:

```{r}
# set to interactive view mode
tmap_mode('view')

tm_shape(bike_blvds) +
  tm_lines()
```

As usual, we'll want to do our usual data exploration...

```{r}
head(bike_blvds)
```

```{r}
dim(bike_blvds)
```

```{r}
colnames(bike_blvds)
```

Our bike boulevard data includes the following information:

 - `BB_STRNAM` - bike boulevard Streetname
 - `BB_STRID` - bike boulevard Street ID
 - `BB_FRO` - bike boulevard origin street
 - `BB_TO` - bike boulevard end street
 - `BB_SECID`- bike boulevard section id
 - `DIR_` - cardinal directions the bike boulevard runs
 - `Status` - status on whether the bike boulevard exists
 - `ALT_bikeCA` - ? 
 - `Shape_len` - length of the boulevard in meters 
 - `len_km` - length of the boulevard in kilometers
 - `geometry`


<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Question**

Why are there 211 features when we only have 8 bike boulevards?


And now take a look at our CRS...

```{r}
st_crs(bike_blvds)
```

We can see that the CRS of the bike blvds dataframe is UTM Zone 10N, NAD83. This is a common CRS for locations in Northern CA.

### Alameda County Schools

Alright! Now that we have our bike boulevard data squared away, we're going to bring in our Alameda County school data.

```{r}
schools_df = read.csv(here("notebook_data",
                           "alco_schools.csv"))

head(schools_df)
```

```{r}
dim(schools_df)
```

<img src="http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Light-Bulb-Free-PNG-Image.png" width="20" align=left >  **Questions** Without looking ahead:

1. Is this a geodataframe? 
2. How do you know?


<br>
<br>
This is not an `sf` data.frame! A couple of clues to figure that out are..

1. We're pulling in a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file, which is not a geospatial data format
2. There is no geometry column (although we do have latitude and longitude values)


-------------------------------

Although our school data is not starting off as an `sf` data.frame, we actually have the tools and information to make it one. Using the `st_as_sf` function, we can transform our plain data.frame into an `sf` data.frame by:

- specifying the columns containings the points' coordinates 

- and the identifying the CRS of the data (*How do we know what it is?*)

```{r}
schools_sf = st_as_sf(schools_df,
                       coords = c('X', 'Y'),
                       crs = 4326)
head(schools_sf)
```

```{r}
dim(schools_sf)
```

You'll notice that the spatial dataframe is almost the same as what we had as a data.frame, except with one less column (because the two coordinate columns, `X`, and `Y`, were consumed into a single `geometry` column.

Now that it's an `sf` data.frame, we can map it with the `plot` method for it just as we did for our other data sets. Notice that this is our first **point** dataset.

```{r}
plot(schools_sf)
```

But of course we'll want to transform the CRS, so that we can later plot it with our bike boulevard data.

```{r}
schools_utm10 = st_transform(schools_sf, crs = 26910)
```

And keep in mind that we can always use `tmap` to plot any of our datasets.

Here's how we can use the tmap `tm_dots` function for point data:

```{r}
tm_shape(schools_utm10) +
  tm_dots(col = 'purple', 
          border.col = 'white', 
          border.lwd = 2, 
          size = 0.2)
```

### Writing Data to a CSV file

In Lesson 2 we discussed that you can save out `sf` data.frames in multiple file formats. You could opt for a GeoJSON, a shapefile, etc... However, for point data sets it is also an option to save it out as a CSV since each geometry only has a single X and single Y value.

```{r, eval=F}
st_write(obj = schools_utm10, 
         dsn = here("outdata",
                    "schools_utm10.csv"), 
         layer_options = "geometry=AS_XY", 
         delete_dsn = T)
```
 

## 4.4 Map Overlays with `tmap`

No matter the geometry type we have for our `sf` data.frame, we can create overlay plots.

Since we've already done the legwork of transforming our CRS, we can go ahead and plot them together.

- Note, we add lines to the `tmap` with the `tm_lines` function.

```{r}
tm_shape(schools_utm10) + 
  tm_dots(size = 0.1) +
  tm_shape(bike_blvds) +
  tm_lines(col = 'red')
```


### Practice

Now try that same map with the `schools_sf` dataframe instead of the `schools_utm10` dataframe. What does the output tell you about `tmap`?

```{r}
## Your code here!

```

> Yeh, `tmap` will dynamically transform (reproject) spatial dataframes so that they can overlay in the same map if the CRS of each dataframe is defined. If it is not defined, `tmap` will assume the WGS84 crs.

### Asking questions of the data

If we want to answer questions like *"What schools are close to bike boulevards in Berkeley?"*, the above plot isn't super helpful, since the extent covers all of Alameda county.

- How could you answer this question with the data we have used in this lesson?


## 4.5 Recap

In this lesson we learned a several new skills:
- We looked at different R packages for making maps.
- Took a deeper look at `tmap` and interactive mapping
- Transformed a non-spatial data.frame into an `sf` spatial data.frame
- Worked with point and line datasets


## Exercise: Overlay Mapping

Let's take some time to practice reading in and reconciling new datasets, then mapping them together.

In the code cell provided below, write code to:

1. Extract the Berkeley boundary from the CA Places data
2. Create a static tmap with the Berkeley boundary, the Berkeley Bike Boulevards, and the Alameda County Schools, subset to the city of Berkeley.
3. Repeat the above as an interactive `tmap`.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE:







```

## Solution hidden here!

*To see it, right-click and select "inspect element" in your browser (or look in the `04_More_Data_More_Maps.Rmd` file near line 427.)*

<!--

# SOLUTION

# 1. Subset Berkeley from CA places data
berkeley = ca_places[ca_places$NAME == 'Berkeley',]

# 2. Subset the schools to Berkeley
berkeley_schools = schools_sf[schools_sf$City == 'Berkeley',]

# 2. Overlay data on a static tmap
tmap_mode('plot')

berkeley_map <- tm_shape(berkeley) + 
  tm_borders(col = 'blue') +
tm_shape(bike_blvds) + 
  tm_lines(col = 'black') +
tm_shape(berkeley_schools) +
  tm_dots(col = "purple")

# 3. Overlay on interactive tmap
ttm()

berkeley_map

-->

## 4.6 Teaser for Part 2...

You may be wondering if and how we could make our maps more interesting and informative than we have so far.

To give you a tantalizing taste of Part 2, the answer is yes, we can! And here's how (using an approach we hinted at earlier on)!

```{r}
tm_shape(schools_utm10) + 
  tm_dots(col = 'Org', 
          palette = 'RdYlGn',
          size = 0.15, 
          border.col = 'black',
          title = 'Public and Private Schools, Alameda County')
```
